#### Solution
The answers are: Ice, Ghost, Branch Prediction, Side-channel attack, vulnerability, kaiser, intel, 2017, 5754, 5753, 5715

`1st Question:`

Water frozen into a solid state? Ice (Meltdown of ice)

`2nd Question:`

An apparition of a dead person which is believed to appear or become manifest to the living? Ghost (Ghost ~ Spectre)

`3rd Question:`

Approach to computer architecture that attempts to mitigate the costs of branching by predicting which path will be taken? (2 words) Branch Prediction (Spectre exploits the branch prediction mechanism to access a location in the program's memory space)

`4th Question:`

Attack based on information gained from the physical implementation of a computer system, rather than weaknesses in the implemented algorithm itself? Side-Channel Attack (Spectre and meltdown are exploited in combination with a side-channel attack)

`5th Question:`

A weakness which allows an attacker to reduce a system's information assurance? vulnerability (spectre and meltdown are vunerabilities)

`6th Question:`

Emperor in German? Kaiser (kaiser is the old name of Kernel page-table isolation KPTI which is a linux kernel feature that mitigates the Meltdown security vulnerability (4th letter)

`7th Question:`

The processors found in most personal computers? intel (Spectre and meltdown are affecting intel processors) (3rd letter)

`8th Question:`

Year of apparition of WannaCry? 2017 (date d'apparition de meltdown et spectre)

`9th Question:`

0001011001111010, 0001011001111001, 0001011001010011? (3 numbers) 5754, 5753, 5715 ( CVE-2017-5754, CVE-2017-5753, CVE-2017-5715)

```
The flag is: THC18{meltdown_spectre}.
